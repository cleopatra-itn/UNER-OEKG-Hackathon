# UNER-OEKG-Hackathon

Universal Named Entity Recognition (UNER) is a framework hierarchy composed of 3 levels:

- 1st: 8 broad categories 
- 2nd: 47 named-entity types
- 3rd: 69 subtypes

3-step Data-set creation:

- 1) Extraction of texts and metadata from Wikipedia (EN and HR) 
- 2) Identication of the DBpedia classes via the hyperlinks associated with certain tokens (entities) 
- 3) Translation to UNER types and sub-types

Number of Entities:

- English: 630,519 
- Croatian: 157,418
